# base16-faded
A faded yet colorful scheme for Vim.

## Requirements
* We have to prepare `.Xresources` first.

Save [the colorscheme file](https://github.com/aesophor/dotfiles/blob/master/.x/colorscheme/base16-faded) as `~/.x/colorscheme/base16-faded`,

then add the following two lines in `.Xresources`
```
! Colors (Replace aesophor with your username)
#include "/home/aesophor/.x/colorscheme/base16-faded"
```

## Installation
* Installing via [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start):
add to `.vimrc` in the Vundle plugin section.
```
Plugin 'aesophor/base16-faded'
```

then fire up `vim`, and run `:PluginInstall`

* Installing via [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#installation):
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/aesophor/base16-faded
```

## Post-Installation
Enable base16-faded in your `.vimrc`
```
set t_Co=256
syntax on
colorscheme base16-faded
```

Also consider install the [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) plugin to enable an airline theme.

I'm using [minimalist](https://github.com/dikiaap/minimalist) by [dikiaap](https://github.com/dikiaap/).
```
let g:airline_theme='minimalist'
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
```
